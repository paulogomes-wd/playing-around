### Summary
* My humble opinion: CSS variable are simply amazing and this course as well

* CSS variables are also know as "Custom Properties", they look like regular CSS properties with a "--" before them --> " --my-property: value; "

* CSS variables must be declared inside a select, which will define the "scope" of the respective variable. But if you want to define a variable that is "visible" along all the document you can define it inside the ":root" pseudo-class --> " :root { /* Custom Properties here */ } "

* Obs: The "guys" who will use these variables "access" the through the "var css method" --> " selector { css-property: var(--custom-property); } "
